* Due to limitations of UserJS, I can't access
  Opera preferences and search engines, so I can't
  autogenerate the searches commands for all your
  user-defined search engines

* The "ubiquity" window is attached to each document.
  I don't know of a way to attach it to the browsers chrome.
  This leads to multiple ubiquity windows, one for each
  document, that don't share their state

* It's not possible to load scripts or JSON content
  from other sites, due to XSS restrictions
