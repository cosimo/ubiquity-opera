----------------------------------------------
An attempt to rewrite Firefox's Ubiquity extension
for Opera using UserJS.
----------------------------------------------

Original Ubiquity Project: http://labs.mozilla.org/ubiquity/

To use this in Opera, you have to:

- Enable UserJS. Point your browser to opera:config#Javascript and:

  - tick "User Javascript" checkbox
  - type the folder you want to run the scripts from
    in the "User Javascript File" textfield

  If you want, you can also allow UserJS execution in
  HTTPS pages.

- Remove the default shortcut key bound to CTRL + SPACE,
  since the original Ubiquity is activated and deactivated
  with CTRL + SPACE.

- Copy ubiquity.js (or the minified version, ubiquity-min.js)
  in your User Javascript folder. Restart the browser,
  and...

have fun!
